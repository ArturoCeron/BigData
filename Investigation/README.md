# Elbow Method
In cluster analysis, the elbow method is a heuristic used in determining the number of clusters in a data set. 
The method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use.

As show in the figure this is a graph of any given data set we have plot a graph for wcss(with in cluster sum of square), and by applying different no of cluster in Model we 
calculate wcss and plot graph where this graph showing change is less change in wcss value we consider that as elbow point,
and this will be the number of valid cluster for given data set.
