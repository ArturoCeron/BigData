# Pair Coding 

<div align="justify"> As the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work using only one machine.
Each one has a keyboard and a mouse. One programmer acts as the driver who codes while the other will serve as the observer who will check the code being written, 
proofread and spell check it, while also figuring out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa.

It’s also commonly called “pairing”, “programming in pairs”, and “paired programming.”

## Pair Programming Advantages

There are several compelling reasons you should consider this strategy:

* Two heads are better than one. If the driver encounters a hitch with the code, there will be two of them who’ll solve the problem.
* More efficient. Common thinking is that it slows down the project completion time because you are effectively putting two programmers to develop a single program, 
instead of having them work independently on two different programs. But studies have shown that two programmers working on the same program are only 15% slower than when these 
programmers work independently, rather than the presupposed 50% slow down.
* Fewer coding mistakes. Because there is another programmer looking over your work, it results in better code. In fact, an earlier study shows that it results in 15% 
fewer bugs than code written by solo programmers. Plus, it allows the driver to remain focus on the code being written while the other attends to external matters or interruption.
* An effective way to share knowledge. Code Fellows talks about how it could help programmers learn from their peers in this blog post. It would allow programmers to get 
instant face-to-face instruction, which is much better than online tutorials and faster than looking for resources on the Internet. Plus, you can learn things better from 
your partner, especially in areas that may be unfamiliar to you. Developers can also pick up best practices and better techniques from more advanced programmers. 
It can also facilitate mentoring relationships between two programmers.
* Develops your staff’s interpersonal skills. Collaborating on a single project helps your team to appreciate the value of communication and teamwork.

In sum, it helps your programmers learn from each other while coming up with programs and applications with better code quality and fewer bugs.
