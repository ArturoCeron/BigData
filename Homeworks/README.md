# Pearson's correlation coefficient

<div align="justify"> Pearson's correlation coefficient, designed for quantitative variables (minimum interval scale), is an index that measures the degree of covariation between different linearly related variables.
Note that we say "linearly related variables." This means that there may be variables strongly related, but not in a linear way, in which case the Pearson correlation will not be applied. 
For example, the relationship between anxiety and performance is shaped like an inverted U; Likewise, if we relate population and time, the relationship will be exponential. 
In these cases (and in many others) it is not convenient to use Pearson's correlation. We insist on this point, which seems to be forgotten with some frequency.
The Pearson correlation coefficient is an index that is easy to perform and also easy to interpret. 
Let's say, in the first instance, that its absolute values oscillate between 0 and 1. 
That is, if we have two variables X and Y, and we define the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables as rxy then:

<div align="justify"> We have specified the terms "absolute values" since, in reality, if the sign is considered, the Pearson correlation coefficient oscillates between –1 and +1. 
However, it should be noted that the magnitude of the relationship is specified by the numerical value of the coefficient, the sign reflecting the direction of such value. 
In this sense, a relationship of +1 is as strong as -1. In the first case the relationship is perfect positive and in the second perfect negative. 
We proceed to develop these concepts further.
We say that the correlation between two variables X and Y is perfect positive when exactly as one of them increases, the other increases. 
This happens when the relationship between both variables is functionally exact.
It is said that the relationship is perfect negative when exactly as one variable increases, the other decreases.

Pearson's correlation coefficient is defined by the following expression:

---

That is, the Pearson correlation coefficient refers to the mean of the cross products of the standardized scores of X and Y. 
This formula has some properties that make it preferable to others. To operate with standardized scores is a scale-free index of measurement. 
On the other hand, its value oscillates, as already indicated, in absolute terms, between 0 and 1.
